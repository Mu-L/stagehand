`extract()` grabs structured text from the current page using structured schemas. Given instructions and `schema`, you will receive structured data.

### `extract` a single object

Here is how an `extract` call might look for a single object:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```javascript
const item = await page.extract({
  instruction: "extract the price of the item",
  schema: z.object({
    price: z.number(),
  }),
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
item = await page.extract("extract the price of the item")
# Python extract returns a dictionary with the extracted data
# For structured extraction, you can also specify the expected format in the instruction
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Your output schema will look like:
```
{ price: number }
```

### `extract` a link
<Note>To extract links or URLs, specify this clearly in your instruction. See the snippet below: </Note>

Here is how an `extract` call might look for extracting a link or URL.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```javascript
const extraction = await stagehand.page.extract({
  instruction: "extract the link to the 'contact us' page",
  schema: z.object({
    link: z.string().url(),
  }),
});

console.log("the link to the contact us page is: ", extraction.link);
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
extraction = await stagehand.page.extract("extract the link to the 'contact us' page")

print("the link to the contact us page is: ", extraction)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### `extract` a list of objects

Here is how an `extract` call might look for a list of objects.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```javascript
const apartments = await stagehand.page.extract({
  instruction:
    "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details, including address, price, and square feet."
  schema: z.object({
    list_of_apartments: z.array(
      z.object({
        address: z.string(),
        price: z.string(),
        square_feet: z.string(),
      }),
    ),
  })
})

console.log("the apartment data is: ", apartments);
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
apartments = await stagehand.page.extract(
  "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details as a list, including address, price, and square feet for each apartment"
)

print("the apartment data is: ", apartments)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Your output schema will look like:
```
  list_of_apartments: [
      {
        address: "street address here",
        price: "$1234.00",
        square_feet: "700"
      },
      {
         address: "another address here",
         price: "1010.00",
         square_feet: "500"
      },
      .
      .
      .
  ]
```

<Tip>For JavaScript: You can provide additional context at the field level within your schema using `.describe()`. For Python: Include specific formatting requirements in your instruction string.</Tip>

<Tab title="JavaScript">
```javascript
const apartments = await stagehand.page.extract({
 instruction:
   "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details, including address, price, and square feet."
 schema: z.object({
   list_of_apartments: z.array(
     z.object({
       address: z.string().describe("the address of the apartment"),
       price: z.string().describe("the price of the apartment"),
       square_feet: z.string().describe("the square footage of the apartment"),
     }),
   ),
 })
})
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
apartments = await stagehand.page.extract(
  "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details as a list. For each apartment, include: the address of the apartment, the price of the apartment, and the square footage of the apartment"
)
```

### **Arguments:** [`ExtractOptions<T extends z.AnyZodObject>`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/blob/main/types/stagehand.ts)

  <ParamField path="instruction" type="string" required>
    Provides instructions for extraction
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="schema" type="z.AnyZodObject" required>
    Defines the structure of the data to extract (JavaScript only)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="iframes" type="boolean" optional>
      Set `iframes: true` if the extraction content exists within an iframe.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="useTextExtract" type="boolean" deprecated>
    This field is now **deprecated** and has no effect.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="selector" type="string" optional>
      An xpath that can be used to reduce the scope of an extraction. If an xpath is passed in, `extract` will only process
      the contents of the HTML element that the xpath points to. Useful for reducing input tokens and increasing extraction
      accuracy.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="modelName" type="AvailableModel" optional>
    Specifies the model to use
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="modelClientOptions" type="object" optional>
    Configuration options for the model client. See [`ClientOptions`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/blob/main/types/model.ts).
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="domSettleTimeoutMs" type="number" optional>
    Timeout in milliseconds for waiting for the DOM to settle
  </ParamField>

### **Returns:** [`Promise<ExtractResult<T extends z.AnyZodObject>>`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/blob/main/types/stagehand.ts)

Resolves to the structured data as defined by the provided `schema`.
